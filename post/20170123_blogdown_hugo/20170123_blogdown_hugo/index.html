  <h2 id="why-blogdown">Why Blogdown?</h2>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve <a href="../time-for-webpage-update/">noted before</a>, my previous website was pretty basic. While it was largely simple to make updates, it wasn&rsquo;t particularly elegant. It was functional, and definitely looked reasonable when it was first created. Editing it wasn&rsquo;t too difficult, but took some forethought if I wanted to make updates across the website. I&rsquo;m not at all trained in web development, and just I picked up a few things by working off a template a friend created for me, and toying around with some .js code in leaflet maps (and lots of googling of course); thus, I might have missed some things that would have made my life a lot easier, but here I am.</p>
<p>In the middle/end of grad school I picked up a suite of tools which I now use regularly - namely <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R</a>, <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> (and <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a>, among others. The R package, <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/09/11/announcing-blogdown/">Blogdown</a>, which was only developed in recent years, facilitates using R/R markdown/Markdown to make a better-looking website that is easier to update. Blogdown relies on <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, a static page generator that can compile markdown files with templates into full webpages.</p>
<p>This post is intended to summarize some aspects of Blogdown, Hugo, and getting it all set up with GitHub Pages as I figured it out, as well as highlight some things I learned.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-blogdown">Getting Started with Blogdown</h2>
<p>Thankfully, I&rsquo;m far from the first person who&rsquo;s used Blogdown to get a website going, and there&rsquo;s even a <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">free e-book</a> by <a href="https://yihui.name">Yihui Xie</a>, <a href="https://amber.rbind.io">Amber Thomas</a>, and <a href="https://alison.rbind.io">Alison Presmanes Hill</a> on the topic. There are also numerous blogs, including <a href="https://www.tylerclavelle.com/code/2017/blogdown/">this one</a> I&rsquo;ve found useful. If you&rsquo;re just getting started, definitely go through the first  chapters of the e-book and try to get something going on your local machine before getting your site online.</p>
<h3 id="choosing-a-hugo-theme-and-making-some-minor-changes">Choosing a Hugo Theme and Making some Minor Changes</h3>
<p>An important step in setting up your site that will be generated via Hugo is choosing a Theme - i.e., a template that you&rsquo;ll adjust and feed your content into for rendering. You can think through what your needs are, and filter by different characteristics. For example, I wanted my site to be responsive, so I only looked at <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/tags/responsive/">themes that were tagged as such</a>. Then, I browsed through some of the demos, and saw what elements they had. Having clear links to social media pages and such seemed useful, as well as having a way to create a fairly straightforward blog. As indicated on the left panel of this page, I went with the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/blackburn/">Blackburn theme</a> developed by <a href="http://yoshiharuyamashita.com/">Yoshiharu Yamashita</a>. It was aesthetically pleasing, had fairly recent commits in the GitHub repo (indicating it is still maintained), and seemed fairly customizable.</p>
<p>I started by following the workflow suggested in the aforementioned e-book, adjusting configuration settings (in the configuration file, <em>config.toml</em>) that comes with the template to make sure I could adjust some things I wanted, and went from there. In particular, below is my initial code, run in <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># Install packages and dependencies
install.packages(&quot;blogdown&quot;)
blogdown::install_hugo()
install.packages(&quot;later&quot;)

# Set up web project
blogdown::new_site(dir = &quot;blackburnFiles&quot;, #New Directory within working directory where web content will be stored
                   theme = 'yoshiharuyamashita/blackburn', #theme information
                   format = 'toml') #specify toml instead of yaml
				   
#To build and view default page
setwd(&quot;blackburnFiles&quot;)
blogdown::build_site()
blogdown::serve_site()
</code></pre><p>There were a few particular things that I wanted to adjust in the config file - some were pretty self-explanatory and others were a matter of trial and error. Particular things I edited in the config.toml file (which can easily be done within RStudio or any text editor) are noted below, followed by the original config file with notes included after hashtags [Note: Some comments were already included]. Also, I&rsquo;ll add that some of these edits might be very specific to the Blackburn theme, but I honestly haven&rsquo;t done enough exploration at this point to verify. (Any quick insights are welcome.) The LiveReload functionality was handy, as every time I&rsquo;d save an edit to the config.toml file, I&rsquo;d see the result pretty much immediately. More details on configuration files are <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/configuration.html">here</a>; I didn&rsquo;t make a ton of adjustments, mostly focusing on making it work for my immediate purposes.</p>

<p>High level page listing.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure where the icons next to the label came from, but from googling the code snippet preceding the name of the pages in the config file, found these were <a href="http://fontawesome.io/">Font Awesome</a> icons You can find a whole bunch of alternatives to use as you see appropriate.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Because Font Awesome is pulling from a remote source, if you&rsquo;re testing without  internet the icons will be lacking. (There are other elements in the theme that seem to rely on remote info, such as the font, so if you&rsquo;re testing without internet access, don&rsquo;t freak out about strange appearances yet.)</em></li>

</code></pre><p>There are still one or two things I would consider editing, which might not have been as obvious to do and simply weren&rsquo;t a high priority. For example, it would be great to add, with the social media links, a link to my Google Scholar profile (likely of interest for lots of academics).</p>
<h3 id="editing-pages">Editing Pages</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see that in the config file that comes with the Blackburn template, the high level page listing in the side menu directs to specific folders (e.g., &ldquo;/About/&rdquo; for the <em>About</em> page). However, at least when starting everything from blogdown, there is a folder within &lsquo;content&rsquo; called &lsquo;post&rsquo;, where blog posts are saved (as Markdown/R Markdown files, to be compiled on website build), but then there are simply &lsquo;about.md&rsquo; and &lsquo;contact.md&rsquo; files. For my own organization, I decided to set up folders for each main page, such that I could keep my content organized with any related files. Thus, in my &lsquo;content&rsquo; folder, I have folders for each relevant page, with an index.md file, and all associated files, such as images. When the site is built, all content gets organized appropriately in the &lsquo;public&rsquo; folder.</p>
<p>From RStudio, there are add-ins you can use to make life a bit easier in creating new blog posts and such. These are detailed <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/rstudio-ide.html">here</a>. I&rsquo;ll note that at this point, I&rsquo;m just starting with new text files, filling in an appropriate yaml header (based on the template md/Rmd files) and going from there, though we&rsquo;ll see how/if I adjust in the future. I definitely recommend checking out the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/output-format.html">relevant section of the Blogdown book on R Markdown vs Markdown</a> to better think through when you might use each in this context. And if you&rsquo;re not familiar with either, definitely do some googling.</p>
<h3 id="hosting-on-github">Hosting on Github</h3>
<p>There are multiple ways to host a site created via blogdown, detailed in the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/deployment.html">deployment</a> section of the e-book. Since I already had experience with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and had a site there already, it made sense for me to stick with it, realizing it might not be the easiest way to host blogdown/hugo pages, and figuring I&rsquo;ll learn a thing or two.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re new to github pages, you&rsquo;ll need to set up a repository titled [username].github.io, add your content, and initialize the page through settings for your repo. (Lots of online resources are out there for getting started.)</p>
<p>GitHub Pages is set up to work with another static site generator, Jekyll, but can work with Hugo-driven pages without too much trouble (or plain old html files). I give an overview of how I did things in the steps below - this is what made sense to and worked, though definitely check out the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/github-pages.html">relevant section of the blogdown e-book for more</a>, as well as a <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/">hugo page about hosting on GitHub Pages</a></p>
<ol>
<li>Set up a <a href="https://github.com/mltConsEcol/WebsiteFiles">repository for all of my web files, &ldquo;WebsiteFiles&rdquo;</a>. Basically I created the repo via the GitHub website, cloned it to my local machine. I had already been testing things locally, so just copied the files created from blogdown::newsite() with the edits I made, and after using <code>blogdown::build_site()</code>.</li>
<li>I copied the contents of the &lsquo;public&rsquo; folder to the repository associated with GitHub Pages(mltconsecol.github.io), and deleted the contents from the &lsquo;public&rsquo; folder in the &lsquo;WebsiteFiles&rsquo; folder/repository (but leave the actual folder - just leave it empty). In the GitHub Pages repo, simply put these files in the highest level (i.e., <strong>do not put them in a folder within the repo called &lsquo;public&rsquo;</strong>).
<ol>
<li>I also added a blank file called .nojekyll to the &lsquo;public&rsquo; folder (now in the GitHub Pages repo), which can help avoid problems of GitHub pages trying to rebuild a page via Jekyll (which won&rsquo;t work, resulting in an error).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>After pushing all of the content you just moved to your GitHub Pages repo, you can copy this content back into the WebsiteFiles/public as a git submodule. This was entirely new to me, but basically allows you to maintain a Git-tracked directory within another one. The basic git command for this is <code>git submodule add -b master git@github.com:[username]/[username].github.io.git public</code>.
<ol>
<li>In my case, this required setting up an ssh key, which I had never done before with Git. (It also reminded me to set up two-factor authentication for GitHub - important and easy for added security.) The error I received included &ldquo;<code>Error: Permission denied (publickey)</code>.&rdquo; Thankfully there are <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/error-permission-denied-publickey/">great docs on how to deal with this</a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>As you edit your content and rebuild the site, you can commit and push your changes to your high-level folder/repository (WebsiteFiles, in my case), as well as the <em>public</em> folder, needed for the changes to take shape on your actual website.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="other-notes">Other notes</h3>
<p>There are a few other notes worth raising before wrapping up.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s important that users realize the themes are often times being updated through time. How should I, as somebody with a website keep up with such changes? A quick post to the <a href="https://twitter.com/pjs_228/status/950095675961864194">twitter-verse</a> indicated to set up the theme using a git submodule framework. A quick google around this yields some useful results, such as <a href="http://choomnuan.com/blog/2015/07/18/how-to-setup-hugos-theme-using-git-submodule/">this post</a>, among others. At this point I haven&rsquo;t done this - but might be good practice for the future, or might add it&rsquo;s own complexities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you keep your files in Dropbox folders or similar and sync across multiple computers, make sure you don&rsquo;t mess up your syncing! Ideally, make sure your computers are synced before making changes. This caused me some issues at some point, and I had to restore an earlier version of my work after wondering why nothing was rendering right. Because there can be a bunch of files that get re-created upon each build, it might take a minute or two for syncing to complete, depending on your content, connection, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For testing purposes, I tried to simply set up the new website as a new page-enabled github repo on the same account my website is hosted from. I ended up running into some issues, in which I had problems with links to internal pages breaking, or strangely the sidebar not popping up on mobile/narrow screens. (I messed around with options to adjust the &lsquo;baseurl&rsquo; as seemingly appropriate and such, but never got everything working.) Thus, I ended up testing a bit more completely by running the website from another GitHub account, and didn&rsquo;t actually fix the issues I was facing in running as another GitHub project. At this point I&rsquo;m just saving that for another time, when an actual need comes up. I was more worried about getting this site to be functional and live, and apparently I&rsquo;ve gotten there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At this point I&rsquo;ve decided to add a <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> comments section. Googling around about disqus and hugo, it seems a lot of folks aren&rsquo;t the biggest fans (see <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/alternative-to-disqus-needed-more-than-ever/5516">here</a>). That said, as I&rsquo;ve noted before, I&rsquo;m interested in getting this site up and running functionally, and especially for posts like this I see functionality in having a comment section. Thus, I&rsquo;ve added disqus-based comments here, realizing I can always disable it if I need. And I conveniently just stumbled upon <a href="https://portfolio.peter-baumgartner.net/2017/09/10/how-to-install-disqus-on-hugo/">this useful blog post</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit, 9 Feb 2018: The rss feeds produced by default don&rsquo;t pass testing via the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/">W3C Feed Validation Service</a>. Check out this blog post from the <a href="https://coolbutuseless.bitbucket.io/2018/02/07/blogdown-rss-feed-of-full-articles/">Cool but Useless</a> blog on how to fix this. For the blackburn template I used, there was no rss.xml file in the layouts folder, so I made one using the template <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/rss/#the-embedded-rss-xml">here, from  the hugo webpage</a>.</p>
