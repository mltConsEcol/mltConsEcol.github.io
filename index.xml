      <description>Time for a Change I got my original website started in the beginning of grad school (circa 2007), with great help from a college friend. As this one, it was static, but relied directly on CSS and HTML, with no real page generator in the sense of Jekyll or Hugo. It&amp;rsquo;s been great for me - serving as a place to link other projects I&amp;rsquo;ve developed; for example, a QGIS tutorial I wrote for a workshop, and materials from a GIS/Spatial Analysis course I taught as a postdoc.</description>

      <description>A Bit About Me: I work as the Urban Spatial Planner for The Nature Conservancy&amp;rsquo;s New York City Program. In this role I use GIS, Remote Sensing, and statistical tools to characterize the current open space in the city, while thinking about how we can improve the state of biodiversity and develop resilience to climate change. I grew up in Staten Island, NY, and am delighted to now be working on conservation issues of my entire home city.</description>

Current Work My current work is broadly focused on using statistical and and GIS tools to inform conservation efforts. Working for The Nature Conservancy in New York City, I using available remote sensing data and GIS datasets to characterize open space dynamics, understand how connected wildlife populations might be across the city, and map previously-unmapped assets, like green roofs.</description>

      <description>QGIS Tutorial QGIS is a well-developed, open source GIS program, with a wide range of features and great compatability with numerous formats. Furthermore, basic installation includes linkages with other open source GIS tools such as GRASS GIS and SAGA (among others). It is one primary software packages that I use in research and teach in classes.
This tutorial is designed to familiarize GIS users with the general layout, features and tools of QGIS, through working with sample datasets that are provided.</description>
